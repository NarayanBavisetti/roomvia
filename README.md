```

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Supabase project (URL + anon key)
- Cloudinary account (optional for image uploads)

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment

Create `.env.local` in `roomvia-landing/` with:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
# Optional â€“ used by /api/upload if you enable uploads via a proxy route
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=xxxx
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=xxxx
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=xxxx
```

### Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Database & Auth

- Supabase is used for Auth (OTP email/SMS) and Postgres DB.
- Profiles table supports both `user_id` and legacy `id` PK shapes (the code handles either).
- On first login, the app ensures a profile exists and auto-creates a friendly username from the email before `@` (unique, sanitized). It writes to `profiles.name` or falls back to `profiles.full_name` if `name` doesnâ€™t exist.

### Key tables (high-level)

- `profiles`: `user_id` (or `id`), `name`/`full_name`, `account_type`, `avatar_url`, `locked`
- `flats`: listing data, images, attributes
- `flatmates`: user preferences, location, budget, amenities
- `saves`: saved flats and people
- `chats`, `messages`: conversations and messages (supports legacy and current schemas)

Migrations and schema helpers live in `database/` and root SQL files (e.g., `supabase-*.sql`).

## Notable modules

### Auth (`src/lib/auth.ts`)

- `getUserFast` de-dupes session fetches
- OTP flows for email and phone
- `ensureProfileWithUsername()` creates or backfills a unique `name`/`full_name` from email

### Chat (`src/lib/chat.ts`, `src/contexts/chat-context.tsx`)

- Utilities to create/find chats, send/receive messages, mark read
- Sidebar lists chats with unread badges; chat windows support minimize/expand

### Analytics (`src/app/broker/analytics/` + `src/components/broker/InsightCharts.tsx`)

- Muted axis/legend/tick styles for platform-consistent charts
- Market insights, performance dashboard, recommendations panel

### Flatmates & Listings

- Feature-rich filters (gender, budget, food preference, company, state, city, dynamic area)
- Compact cards with tags, badges, and actions

### Saved items (`/saved`)

- Redesigned UI: stats, segmented tabs, card overlays, and quick actions

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # Start dev server
npm run build      # Production build (typecheck + lint)
npm run start      # Start production server
```

## Deployment

- Any Node-capable host or Vercel works great.
- Set environment variables for Supabase (and Cloudinary if used).

## Contributing

- Fork and create feature branches.
- Keep PRs focused and include screenshots for UI changes.
- Follow the existing code style (typed APIs, clear naming, early returns, minimal nesting).

## Roadmap

- Dark mode and theme switcher
- PDF/CSV export in Analytics
- Push notifications for chat
- Enhanced broker CRM tools
